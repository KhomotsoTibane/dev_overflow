## Project Details

### Opportunity

Addressing the need for a centralized platform for developers to seek assistance and share knowledge is crucial in today's fast-paced tech environment. The web application leverages the power of AI through Chat GPT to provide intelligent and immediate answers to developers' queries.

### What I Did

- Built the frontend using Next.js with TypeScript, ensuring type safety and an enhanced developer experience.
- Implemented a responsive design with Tailwind CSS, providing a sleek and modern user interface.
- Leveraged MongoDB for data storage, utilizing its powerful aggregate functions for complex queries.
- Integrated Clerk for authentication, providing secure and seamless user management.

### Highlights

- **Dark Mode:** Comfortable use in low-light environments.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimal performance and usability across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Fast Performance:** Quick access to information and support.
- **Global Search:** Enhances the user experience by allowing developers to quickly find relevant answers and resources across the entire platform.

### Challenges

- Initially, setting up the project was difficult, especially in aligning everything with the Figma design specifications.
- Working with MongoDB aggregate functions posed a significant hurdle, as mastering their complexity was essential for efficient data manipulation and retrieval.
- Time management was a constant struggle, balancing the demands of coding, debugging, and incorporating new features within the deadlines I had estimated.

### Conclusion

Successfully deployed a responsive platform, gaining traction among the developer community and fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing.
